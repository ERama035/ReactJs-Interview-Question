java script:

1) A closure is a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state, allowing it to access variables from its outer scope even after that scope has exited.
When you define a function inside another function, the inner function has access to:

Its own variables
The variables of the outer function
Global variables
If the inner function is returned or passed elsewhere, it "remembers" the environment in which it was created. This preserved environment is called a closure.

2) difference bet ween let and var :
var is function-scoped and can be redeclared;
let is block-scoped and cannot be redeclared in the same scope.

Feature	var	let
Scope	Function-scoped	Block-scoped (within {})
Hoisting	Hoisted and initialized as undefined	Hoisted but not initialized
Redeclaration	Can be redeclared in the same scope	Cannot be redeclared in the same scope
Reassignment	Can be reassigned	Can be reassigned
Global Object	Declared in global scope, becomes property of window	Does not become property of window

3) 
Es6 Feature	Description:
--------------------------------
Classes	Class-based OOP syntax
Promises	Asynchronous programming
Arrow Functions	Short, lexically-scoped functions
let, const	Block-scoped variable declarations
Default Parameters	Function parameters with default values
Modules	Native import/export
tempalate literal strings


4) what is event loop in java script with precedence ?..
The event loop lets JavaScript handle async operations by processing microtasks (like Promises) before macrotasks (like setTimeout), ensuring efficient and predictable execution order.

5) callback vs promise vs Async/await:
->A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the first function completes its operation. 
and retunts an method or funtions

-> A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
and it retuns a values (or) promise object. Promises provide a simpler way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks
by allowing you to chain multiple operations together and handle errors in a more elegant way.

-> Async/await is the await keyword to wait for a promise to resolve before continuing with the execution with the async keyword, that returns a promise.

async function getData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = 'Some data';
      resolve(data);
    }, 1000);
  });
}


6) what is deep nesting java scipt ?..
Nested functions are one funcion inside of another function.
Defining a function inside another function


7) waht is object prototyping ?..
The mechanisum in the java sciprt object inherit properties and methods from a "prototype" object. Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype.
In JavaScript - objects inherit properties and methods from a "prototype" object, which forms a prototype chain

8) what is event bubling and event capturing ?..

-> Event bubling (child to parent) is the process when an event riggered on a child element propogates (bubles up) to its parenet elements in the DOM hierarchy.
Example the button click on the DIV element , the event handlers on the button will trigger the DIV element in turn trigger the DIV block.

-> Event Handling: The entire system of detecting, listening for, and responding to event

-> Event Capturing: (parent to child) Direction: From the outermost element to the downwards to the target element.
example : the button click on the DIV element both has event handlers, if clicking on the button will trigger the DIV element first , next button

9) what is curlly functions ?.. 
Currly functions are the nested function each of which takes a single arguments.

10) what is object restructing ?..
JavaScript is a feature that allows you to extract properties from objects and bind them to variables,other objects into distinct variables,


11) for of loop  ?..for loop woth cont , var, map
for-each vs for-in  ?.. both are for iterating the data-structure, a)for-each is used for callbacks b) for-in is used for looping the datastructure.

12) fetch api vs axios ?..
-> fetch api is an built-in java script api for making http requests, used for small applications, which returns Promises.
-> Is A popular Third-party Javascript library for making http requests, used for larger applications, and returns Promises.


13) what is shallow copy vs deep copy ?..
    shallow copy:
	const original = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
    const shallowCopy = { ...original };
	deep copy:
	    const original = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
    const shallowCopy = Object.assign({}, original);

14) map vs reduce ?..
-> use when you want to transform to each element and get an new array -> map -> transform each element 
-> use when you want to combine all elements into a single value -> reduce -> aggregate/combine elements.

-----------------------------react------------------------------------
1) functional hooks: with number of paramaters.
usestate, use effect, useselector, usereducer, usememo , usecallback, usecontext, useref, userIMperativehandle, uselayoutEffect, useDebugValue

2) class based lifecylce :
order: constructor , componentDidmount, ComponentDidupdate, CompnentUnmounting

3) can we use hooks in the class based component ?.. no , we can use only in function components
4) can we assign var to the hooks ?.. no
5) React is declarative js ?.. yes

6) Scenario : without using the ifelse statement , how to use useEffect based on the count.
	useEffect(()=>{
		if(count < 5) return;
		console.log('count is 5 or more');
	},[count]);

7) pure components ?.. 
8) use React.PureComponent
9) A Pure Component in React only re-renders when its props or state change, thanks to shallow comparison, helping improve performance and efficiency.

10) what are contollered and not controlledcomponent ?..
Controlled -> React Manages the avlues via state
UnControlled

11) hoc components ?..
A Higher-Order Component (HOC) in React is a function that takes a component/function 
and returns a new component with extra capabilities, making it easy to share logic  and state, props etc 
and features across your app.

React.memo	Memoizes functional components	React (built-in)
connect ->	Connects to Redux store	react-redux
withRouter	-> Injects router props	react-router-dom v5
withTranslation -> 	Injects translation functions	react-i18next
withTheme	-> Injects theme props	styled-components, MUI

12) redux: 
reducer : takes an action (type), state 
    and dispatch that actionwe get the result.
	use selector we get the updated value.
	
13) redux: list of methods in reducers	
Reducers (methods): handle synchronous state updates.
createAsyncThunk: handles asynchronous logic (API calls).
extraReducers: handle async lifecycle or external reducers.
Slices: bundle your reducers + actions + state together cleanly.

14) react will have pure functions ?..
In React, a pure function is a function that returns the same output for the same input (props/state) and does not cause side effects.
That means — your React component should only depend on what’s passed to it (props, state) and not modify anything else outside of it.
React.memo, PureComponent

15) when to useRef hook ?..
Tracking previous values
Keeping mutable state without causing a re-render
If you want to compare previous and current props or state.
Unlike useState, updating useRef doesn’t trigger a re-render, which is useful for values that change frequently but don’t need to update the UI.

16)event propogation ?.. -> 
Event propagation is the way events travel through the DOM when an event is triggered on an element. There are two main phases.
a) Capturing Phase (Event Capture)
b) Target Phase
c) Bubbling Phase (Event Bubble)

what is lexicalscope ?.. ->
Lexical scope means that a function’s scope is determined by where it is declared, not where it is called.
In other words, functions remember the variables from the environment in which they were created.
Closures in JavaScript are based on lexical scoping

17)what is object desctructuring ?.. 
Object destructuring in JavaScript is a shortcut syntax to extract values from objects (or arrays) and assign them to variables in a cleaner and more readable way

18) 
| Function / Method          | Used In | Purpose                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `mapStateToProps`          | Redux   | Map Redux state to component props              |
| `mapDispatchToProps`       | Redux   | Map Redux action dispatchers to component props |
| `mapPropsToValues`         | Formik  | Initialize form values from component props     |
| `getDerivedStateFromProps` | React   | Update component state based on prop changes    |


19) what is react lazy loading ?..
React provides the React.lazy() function to dynamically import components.
You also need to wrap the lazy-loaded component with a <Suspense> component to show a fallback (like a loader) while the component is being loaded.

import React, { Suspense } from "react";

// Lazy load the component
const About = React.lazy(() => import("./About"));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <About />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;


React.lazy(() => import('./About')) → tells React to load About component only when it’s rendered.
<Suspense fallback={...}> → provides a fallback UI while the lazy-loaded component is being fetched.

20) what is code splitting ?.. 
Code Splitting in React (or JavaScript in general) is a technique to split your application code into smaller 
chunks so that only the necessary code is loaded initially, and the rest is loaded on demand.
It is closely related to lazy loading but applies more broadly to bundling and delivery of JavaScript code.

------- How it works ---------

Normally, React apps bundle all JavaScript into a single large file.
With code splitting, tools like Webpack or Vite split the code into multiple bundles, which are loaded only when needed.
This reduces initial load time and improves performance.
examples : 
Route-based splitting: Load each route separately.


21) what are react profilers , react portals , renderprops ?..
1) React Profiler
A tool to measure the performance of your React components.
It helps identify which components render too often, and how long each render takes.
Usage: Wrap a part of your component tree with <Profiler> and provide a callback to log performance data.
Use case: Optimize slow components in large applications.

2) React Portals
Allow rendering a child component into a DOM node outside the parent hierarchy.
Useful for modals, tooltips, and dropdowns where you don’t want CSS overflow or stacking issues.
Benefit: Keeps modal/overlay UI separate from main DOM, solving styling & z-index issues.

3) Render Props
A pattern for sharing logic between components using a prop that is a function.
The child function receives data or behavior and renders UI dynamically.
Benefit: Reusable logic without inheritance, works well before hooks became standard.

19) middleware : it allow to intercetp the changes.
thunk : yes.

20) when we prefer to use context api vs redux.
Small/medium app, few global values	Context API


21) when to use redux state or global state ?..
Large/complex app with multiple data flows	Redux
Need minimal boilerplate but powerful global state	Zustand / Recoil (modern lightweight alternatives)

22) Heavy async operations or API integrations	Redux + Thunk/Saga

23) global store (single source of store ) , reducers , slices , slice and splice method ?..

24) rest operator vs spread operator
Purpose: Collects multiple elements into a single array or object.
Purpose: Expands an array or object into individual elements.

| Feature       | Rest (`...`)                                    | Spread (`...`)                                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose       | Collect remaining elements into an array/object | Expand an array/object into individual elements |
| Usage context | Function parameters, destructuring              | Arrays, objects, function calls                 |
| Example       | `function sum(...nums)`                         | `const arr2 = [...arr1]`                        |
| Output        | Array or object                                 | Individual values                               |


25) map and for each ?..
26) name some array methods ?..

	push() → add element at the end
	pop() → remove element from the end
	shift() → remove element from the start
	unshift() → add element at the start
	splice() → add/remove elements at any position
	sort() → sort array
	reverse() → reverse array

Non-mutating methods (return new array or value):
	map() → transforms each element and returns a new array
	filter() → returns a new array with elements passing a condition
	reduce() → reduces array to a single value
	forEach() → iterates over each element (doesn’t return new array)
	slice() → returns a portion of the array
	concat() → merges arrays
	includes() → checks if value exists
	find() → returns first element that matches condition
	some() → checks if any element satisfies condition
	every() → checks if all elements satisfy condition

27) what is debouncing and throttling ?..

Debouncing
	Ensures a function is called only after a specified delay after the last event.
	Useful for search input, autocomplete to reduce API calls.
	Triggered once after user stops triggering the event.

Throttling
    Ensures a function is called at most once every specified interval.
	Useful for scrolling, infinite scroll, or mouse move.	


28) useDispatch vs useSelector vs useEffect with depencency array ?..

useDispatch:
	Hook from Redux to dispatch actions to the Redux store.
	Used to trigger state changes in the store.

useSelector:
	Hook from Redux to read state from the Redux store.
	Re-renders the component whenever the selected part of the state changes.

useEffect with Dependency Array:
	Hook from React used to run side effects (API calls, subscriptions, timers, DOM updates, etc.).
	Dependency array controls when the effect runs.

30) code :
Increase the counter by clicking the button in react js example ?..
	import React, { useState } from 'react';

	const Counter = () => {
	  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	  const handleIncrement = () => {
		setCount(count + 1);
	  };

	  return (
		<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', marginTop: '50px' }}>
		  <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
		  <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increase</button>
		</div>
	  );
	};

	export default Counter;
